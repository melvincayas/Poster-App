## Future of Poster

I got what I wanted out of this project once I finished the user notifications for follows and likes. My goal was to see what I could accomplish after finishing a [full-stack web developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. After that, I began to learn [React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)!

If I continue this project in the future, I would:

- Recreate the user-interface with React
- Implement infinite scrolling for all posts on the home page
  - It became difficult to reuse components, especially posts without tools like React
- Add color indicators in the navbar to show which page is displayed
