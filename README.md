## Future of This Project

I got what I wanted out of this project once I finished the user notifications for follows and likes. My goal was to see what I could accomplish after finishing a full-stack web developer course on Udemy. After that, I began to learn React!

In the future I'd like to build on what's here by recreating the user-interface with React and to implement infinite scrolling.
